# FML_Competition2020
This is the data repository for Fuzzy Markup Laungage (FML)-based machine learning competition for human and smart machine co-learning on game of Go at IEEE WCCI 2020.

Please visite the competition page => http://oase.nutn.edu.tw/wcci2020-fmlcompetition/

## Goal 
The goal of this competition is to design accurate and interpretable fuzzy rule-based regression models using FML. 

## Competition Data
The data in this competition are derived from the data on the game of Go (https://deepmind.com/alphago-master-series). There are 60 game data available. Each game data include the prediction by Darkforest AI bot and that by EFL OpenGo AI bot. The competition data can be found in the director **"[Comp2020Data](Comp2020Data)"** in this page. Each data file is named "C2020_GameDataG?.csv" (? represents the game number.) This year, we remove the 25th, 48th, and 60th games because the predictions of the winning rates by Darkforest AI bot and EFL OpenGo AI bot are inconsistent. We use **44 game results from the 1st game to 45th game as the training data**. We use **13 game results from the 46th game to 59th game as the test data**. 
For simplicity, we combined the game results and generated two files: **[C2020_TrainData.csv](Comp2020Data/C2020_TrainData.csv)** and **[C2020_TestData.csv](Comp2020Data/C2020_TrainData.csv)**. 

### Data description
Each row represents an instance which consists of 12 input attributes and 2 outputs. 
* The first six inputs are DBSN, DWSN, DBWR, DWWR, DBTMR, and DWTMR at time _t_-1. These values are generated by Darkforest AI bot. (The first letter of each abbreviation represents "D"arkforest.)
* The next six inputs are the same information at time _t_. 
* DBSN: The number of simulations for Black. 
* DWSN: The number of simulations for White. 
* DBWR: The win rate of Black. 
* DWWR: The win rate of White. 
* DBTMR: The top-move rate of Black. 
* DWTMR: The top-move rate of White.
* The two outputs are EBWR at time _t_ and DBWR at time _t_+1.
* EBWR: The win rate of Black predicted by EFL OpenGo AI bot at time _t_. (The first letter of each abbreviation represents "E"FL.)
