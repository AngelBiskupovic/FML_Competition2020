# FML_Competition2020
This is the data repository for Fuzzy Markup Laungage (FML)-based machine learning competition for human and smart machine co-learning on game of Go at IEEE WCCI 2020.

Please visite the competition page => http://oase.nutn.edu.tw/wcci2020-fmlcompetition/

## Goal 
The goal of this competition is to design accurate and interpretable fuzzy rule-based regression models using FML. 

## Competition Data
The data in this competition are derived from the data on the game of Go (https://deepmind.com/alphago-master-series). There are 60 game data available. Each game data include the prediction by Darkforest AI bot and that by EFL OpenGo AI bot. The competition data can be found in the director "Comp2020Data" in this page.
